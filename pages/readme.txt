All the files in this folder differ only in line number 54 (The name of the current page) and the nav-item declared active.
I couldn't think of any other way to show all the pages with static html.
When plugged into the framework, the name can be dynamically updated based on whichever page the router shall route to and thus
only one file would be sufficient if made into an SPA instead of these 8 files.
